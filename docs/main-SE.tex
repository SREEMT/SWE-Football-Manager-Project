\section{Project Description}
% You must complete the following 4 subsections. The instructor will use this information to determine if your project might be feasible or not.

% Comment out the bracketed instructions as you finish subsections
\subsection{Overview}
[Add a few paragraphs describing your project succinctly. What problem are you trying to solve, what is the purpose of your project? Why does your client want this project?]

\subsection{Key Features}
[At this point you should have a basic understanding of your client's needs. List out the key features of the software system the client wants you to build.]

\subsection{Why this Project is Interesting}
[Why did you decide this project was interesting enough to you to be a capstone project? What about this project is enticing? Why should anyone care?]

\subsection{Areas of CS required}
[What subfields of computer science seem most likely to be relevant to your project? A capstone must involve multiple.]

\subsection{Potential Concerns and Questions}
[Is there any aspect of this project that makes you unsure if it will work, either due to your own interests/background, or that you aren't sure if it fits the requirements? Are there questions you have about this project that you want instructor feedback about?]

\subsection{Summary of Efforts to Find a Project}
(Not necessary for 482) [Briefly list out when/how you've discussed with this client, and if you've discussed with other clients who either didn't work out or didn't respond. If you considered a different project and it didn't work out, why didn't it work out?] 

[Most CS495 projects end here. The sections below are for CS482 and CS496 software projects].

\subsection{Comparison to Draft}
[For CS496 only, focus on highlighting the major differences between the draft proposal in CS495 and this one here. If there are no major differences, you can remove this subsection.]

\section{Requirements}

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
[Non-functional requirements are just as important as functional requirements. Dont forget to specify them.]

\subsection{Functional Requirements (User Stories)}
[In CS482, all functional requirements are written as User Stories. In CS496, some projects may use a different template to write the requirements. The table below is an example of writing the Stories. Adapt accordingly to different templates or if you want to display more info.]

\section{System Design}

\subsection{Architecture}
We will be using a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture since the Rails API is designed to support MVC. Frontend will utilize react, backend is using Redis and MongoDB, while the Rails API handles all the endpoints and logic.\\
Potential Main Modules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item User Management Module
    \item Team Management Module
    \item League Management Module
    \item Analytics Module
    \item Admin Panel Module
    \item Notification Module
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Diagrams}
[CS482, on sprints/iterations 2-3, you need to create and update a diagram (check the assignment for which type of diagram). On CS496, since before sprint/iteration 1 you should have a class diagram and keep it up-to-date.]

\subsection{Technology}
\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{8cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Tech} & \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Usage} \\ \hline
Ruby & Language & Backend \\ \hline
Rails & Framework & Web application framework \\ \hline
Docker & Containerizer & Containerize the app for consistency \\ \hline
Redis & RAM-Based Database & Quick data retrieval and updates; ideal for real-time data \\ \hline
React & UI Framework & Used for UI design and implementation \\ \hline
MongoDB & Schema-Based Database & Long-term data storage; performance not critical \\ \hline
RSpec & Testing tool & Used to test ruby code\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Technologies used in the project}
\label{tab:technologies}
\end{table}

\subsection{Coding Standards}
\subsubsection{Naming}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Global Variables:} All caps and underscores for spaces.  
    Examples: \texttt{VARIABLE}, \texttt{TEST}, \texttt{MIN\_NUM}
    
    \item \textbf{Classes:} Capitalized and CamelCase.  
    Examples: \texttt{Class}, \texttt{ClassGuide}, \texttt{ExTwo}
    
    \item \textbf{Functions:} Lowercase with underscores for spaces. Avoid using numbers.  
    Examples: \texttt{function}, \texttt{function\_two}, \texttt{print\_all\_one}
    
    \item \textbf{Variables:} Same as functions, but numbers do not require underscores.  
    Examples: \texttt{n}, \texttt{x}, \texttt{x2}, \texttt{print\_status}
    
    \item \textbf{Files:} File names should be descriptive and follow variable naming rules unless another convention is necessary.  
    Examples: \texttt{test\_file.txt}, \texttt{grid\_layout.py}, \texttt{App.jsx}
    
    \item \textbf{Folders:} Same as files. Keep names general and simple.  
    Examples: \texttt{folder}, \texttt{folder\_two}, \texttt{src}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Code Formatting}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Include a blank line between each function.
    \item Use consistent and readable loop structures.
    \item Place comments above functions and significant code blocks.
    \item Inline comments should be aligned to the right of the code line they describe.
    \item Maintain consistency throughout the codebase.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Commenting Rules}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Comments must be placed above each function explaining its purpose.
    \item Comments must be placed above each class.
    \item Comments should be detailed and easy to understand.
    \item Inline comments (for specific lines) must appear to the right of that line.
    \item Comments for code blocks should be placed above the block and explain its function.
    \item Create and follow standard templates for class and function comments.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Coding Principles}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Follow the \textbf{DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)} principle when designing code.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Testing}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Only allow code with unit tests and with at least 65\% coverage to be committed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data}
[What is the main structure of your data? In SQL-like databases, this would be the planning of the main tables, their attributes, and interactions with other tables (basically an ER diagram). In NoSQL databases, this would be the main collections and general attributes of the JSON you will store in each collection.]

\subsection{UI Mocks}
[Define and draw/sketch/code the main UIs your user will interact with in your software. Add your UI mocks here and a short caption about it. Do not forget about the main forms and CRUD UIs.]


\section{Iterations}

\subsection{Iteration Planning}
[In CS496, you plan all iterations beforehand. In CS482, you update the planning here at each iteration. ]

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c l p{7cm} c}
\hline
\textbf{Iteration} & \textbf{Dates} & \textbf{Stories} & \textbf{Points} \\
\hline
1 & 01/01 - 02/01 & S1 Story Example, S2 Story Example 2 & 07 \\ \hline
2 & 02/01 - 03/01 & S3 Story Title, S4 Story Title, S5 Story Title, S6 Story Title & 17 \\ \hline
3 & 03/01 - 04/01 & S7 Story Title, S8 Story Title, S9 Story Title, S10 Story Title, S11 Story Title & 21 \\ \hline
4 & 04/01 - 05/01 & S12 Story Title, S13 Story Title, S14 Story Title, S15 Story Title & 19 \\ \hline
5 & 05/01 - 06/01 & S16 Story Title, S17 Story Title & 06 \\ \hline
